Advanced database system design concepts

## Availability

- **High availability for reads**
  Sloppy Quorum
  Hinted Hand-off

- **High availability for writes**
  Vector clocks

## Scalability

- _Replication_

- **Partitioning**
  Consistent hashing

## Fault Tolerance

- Replication

## Always Writable Experience

- **Hinted handoff**

## Configure Faster Read-Write

- **Through quorum protocol**

## Anti-entropy

- **Merkle trees**

## Nodes peer-to-peer communication

- **Gossip protocol**

## Failure

- **Temporary Failures Recovery**
  Sloppy quorum
  Hinted hand-off

- **Permanent Failures Recovery**
  Merkle trees (Anti-entropy)

- **Membership and Failure Detection**
  Gossip Protocol

## Consistency

- Data conflict resolution
